## About

The [OOICloud Project](https://github.com/ooicloud) is working to make data from the [Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI)](https://oceanobservatories.org) publically available in the cloud and accessible through a [Pangeo](http://pangeo.io) interface. A primary goal is to provide these data to the scientific community using a cloud-performant object storage model, and to provide large-scale remote compute capabilities for research investigations.

With a generous gift from the [Microsoft AI for Earth](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth) program, OOICloud resides in the [Azure Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com), and currently contains all of the data from the [OOI HD video camera](https://oceanobservatories.org/instrument-class/camhd) deployed at a hydrothermal vent in the caldera of Axial Volcano, a submarine volcano on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. 

## Get started!

During the week of AGU, anyone can log in to the OOICloud Pangeo and start working with OOI HD video data. Here are the steps for getting started:

 1. Log in to [ooi.pangeo.io](https://ooi.pangeo.io) using your GitHub credentials. Choose a minimal machine until you determine that you need more compute power.
 2. Open a terminal window in Jupyterlab and clone the examples repo:
    - ```git clone https://github.com/ooicloud/ooi-pangeo.git```
 3. Run one of the examples in notebooks/camhd! The image_sliders notebook is a fun one.

After AGU, you will need to join the OOICloud GitHub organization to have access to ooi.pangeo.org. We are exploring other potential access models as well. To join OOICloud, send an email to [pangeo@ooicloud.org](mailto:pangeo@ooicloud.org) with your GitHub username.
