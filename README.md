# Welcome to the OOICloud Organization website
## About
OOIcloud connects Microsoft AI on the Azure Cloud with the OOI Cabled Array (OOI-CA) using Pangeo. Using Azure Blob Storage to host the OOI-CA data OOICloud will provide open access to the scientific community. We are also making available an Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) cluster to demonstrate the utility of Azure cloud-based resources for doing science with the OOI data and Azure systems.
